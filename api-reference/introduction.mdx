## Welcome

Tesa Cloud APIs allow you to integrate your Tesa digital platform account with other software applications.

We place emphasis on security and privacy considerations of regulatory compliance of your region of operations.

APIs are built using REST conventions using standard HTTP methods and error response codes. All responses return standard JSON.

Our endpoint guides provide developers interactive samples and sample code to help you create your solutions.
