Tesa Cloud is a secure digital platform built to support connected surgical workflows. It powers surgical planning, procedure documentation, and post-operative reporting — all while ensuring regulatory compliance, data security, and developer extensibility.

This API enables authorized applications to integrate with Tesa Cloud for managing patients, procedures, appointments, reports, and more. If you're building digital tools for healthcare professionals, device integrators, or reporting systems, you're in the right place.

## Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated with an `x-api-key` and `x-api-secret` pair.

To generate credentials:
- Log in to your Tesa Cloud account
- Navigate to **Settings → Developer Settings**
- Create a new key pair (secrets are displayed only once)

API access is protected by:
- Supabase RLS (row-level security)
- Cloudflare WAF and DDoS protection
- Rate limiting and credential hashing at rest

## Best Practices

- Use **environment-specific keys** (e.g. staging vs production)
- Secure your keys using a secrets manager (e.g. GCP Secret Manager)
- Rotate your `x-api-secret` periodically
- Follow a **least privilege principle** in how your app uses the API
- Never expose secrets in frontend code
